- This project was developed to use micropython in OpenComputers.
- If you need a serious Thumb simulator, use [Unicorn](https://www.unicorn-engine.org).
- Some instructions are not implemented properly or are incorrect.
- Interrupts are not supported because isc vectors are not supported.
  (SVC instruction is supported)
- Only application registers are supported.
